# eRef
eRef is an integrated database tool that helps connect voters to legislators, and allows them to see what legislation is voted on and when. https://eref.azurewebsites.net/
NOTE: If you're using this website to try to add items, you need to FIRST CREATE a Legislator. If you do not do this, you will not have the requisite Representative ID to enter while registering a voter or a law. Thank you for reading me!! PLH!!
